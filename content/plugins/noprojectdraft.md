If you're seeing the following error on your Confluence Page, and wanted to know why, this FAQ is for you!

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/atlassian/no_draft.png)

While our Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Server add-on is compatible with Confluence 5.9 and greater, there is a problem with saving our Balsamiq Macro to draft pages on Confluence 5.x. Unfortunately, this is due to a limitation within the Confluence 5.x server software itself, so we have decided to block saving to a draft page all together (we wish we could fix it!)

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Confluence 6 and above customers should not see this error.{{% /alert %}}

Luckily, the workaround is super easy! All you need to do is create your draft page and save it first. Once that is done, you can edit it and [insert a new Balsamiq Wireframes project](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/server/wireframes/intro/#adding-a-new-project-to-a-confluence-page).

We apologize to our Confluence 5.x customers for this extra step, but we felt that bringing you this update was worth it!
