We have partnered with two online education sites, [Udemy](//udemy.com) and [Skillshare](//skillshare.com), to create the following courses. Both are **free**.


* ["Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design"](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Rapid-Wireframing-Finding-the-Right-Product-Design/1947996659) on **Skillshare**
* ["Wireframing with Balsamiq Mockups"](https://www.udemy.com/wireframing-with-balsamiq-mockups/) on **Udemy**

We also [know of one on Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/Balsamiq-Mockups-tutorials/UX-Design-Tools-Balsamiq-Mockups/172857-2.html). You can try searching online as well.
