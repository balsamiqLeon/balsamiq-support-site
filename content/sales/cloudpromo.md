From time to time, we offer promotional codes for Balsamiq Cloud which consist of an extended trial period, longer than the usual 30-day trial offered by default. These codes are strictly shared as a form of [sponsorship](https://balsamiq.com/company/sponsorships) to support events or communities that we want to see succeed, or through cross-marketing partnerships.

**Please DO NOT email us asking to share a promotional code with you.**

If you have received a promo code from us, steps on how to apply it are below.

***

## Applying a Promo Code to Your Space

If you're new to Balsamiq Cloud, you will first [create an account](https://balsamiq.cloud/), and subsequently a [Space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide) before you're able to redeem your code.

After your account and Space are created and verified, login to your Space and visit the **Billing Information** section, which can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your Space.

Enter your promo code in the corresponding field, and then select "Apply". The text will then update to confirm the promo code has been applied correctly, and your new expiration date will appear there.

If you receive an error when applying your promo code, please make sure that you are copying and pasting it exactly as it was given to you.

Please note that these codes **cannot** be applied to paid Spaces or expired trials and subscriptions.
