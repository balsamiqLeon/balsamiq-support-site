Our Mockups 3 for Desktop licenses are named and transferable, meaning that if one of your employees leaves you may recycle that license to a different user.

Transferring a license is very easy:

1.  Select "Unregister from this Computer..." from the Mockups 3 for Desktop Help menu on all the computers of the person that’s no longer going to use it.
2.  [Download and Install Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download) on the new user’s machine and use your License Information (the one you received via email or invoice) to register it.

That's it!

Here’s a little screenshot of all the different screens you’ll be seeing (click on the image to enlarge it):

## Transferring to a New Machine as the Same User?

Our licenses are tied to you, not a particular machine, so just go ahead and register Mockups 3 for Desktop on your new machine with your old License Information. If you will no longer be the user on the old machine, follow the instructions above to un-register Mockups on it.
