The Activate button in Mockups 3 for Desktop is only enabled when a valid License Name / License Key combination is present. Please copy and paste directly from yourÂ email receipt instead of typing your License Information manually.

If you don't have both your License Name and License Key, you can retrieve your full License Information [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/lostkey).

If you're still having trouble, please <span style="font-size: 14.0px;line-height: 1.4285715;"></span> [email us](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=Cannot Activate) a screenshot of your registration dialog and include your License Information in the body of your email, so we can diagnose the issue and get you back to work.
