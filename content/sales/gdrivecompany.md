Unfortunately, we do not yet offer company-wide subscriptions for Balsamiq for Google Drive. Each user will need to purchase a subscription individually for either $5/month or $50/year. Invoices can only be sent to the individual subscriber, though they are easy to [forward to a billing department](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#finding-past-invoices). Full details on signing up for an individual subscription are [here](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#signing-up-for-a-subscription).

However, if you are looking for a tool for your entire company, you might consider our web application, Balsamiq Cloud. It offers unlimited users, and has additional collaborative features for teams working together. You can start a free 30-day trial [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/).

Plans [start](http://balsamiq.com/buy/#cloud) as low as $9/month.
