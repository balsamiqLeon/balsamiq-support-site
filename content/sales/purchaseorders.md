Balsamiq does not accept purchase orders as form of payment nor the terms and conditions commonly associated with purchase orders.

However, we do take payment by wire transfer or check for license orders of $300 or more following the order process described [here](/sales/ordering/#licenses).

You can add a PO number for your tracking purposes on any license purchase following [these steps](/sales/addpo).
