Subscriptions for Balsamiq for Google Drive are sold separately for each Google ID (email address). We do not yet offer [company-wide subscriptions](/sales/gdrivecompany) for Balsamiq for Google Drive.

## Signing up for a Subscription

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first [install](http://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/intro/#getting-started) Balsamiq for Google Drive.

As subscriptions are tied to specific Google IDs, be sure you are logged in to the Google ID (email) with which you plan to use Balsamiq for Google Drive.

At the end of your fully-functional [30-day trial](/sales/evaluate/) period, you will be able to view existing wireframes, but you will not be able to edit or create new wireframes unless you sign up for a paid plan.

Balsamiq for Google Drive is sold as a monthly or yearly subscription paid exclusively via automatic credit card payments.

To sign up for a plan, open Balsamiq for Google Drive by creating a [new project](http://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/intro/#getting-started) (or opening an existing one), and then select **"Sign Up for a Paid Plan"** from the Help menu.

If your trial has expired and you no longer have access to the editor and Help menu, simply open an existing Balsamiq for Google Drive project, and select "Sign Up for a Paid Plan" in the notification bar at the bottom of the wireframe viewer.
