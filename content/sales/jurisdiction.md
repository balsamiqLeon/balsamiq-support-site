We can understand the desire to engage in any litigation in a local and familiar legal system. No doubt, for many of the same reasons, we feel the same way too.

Although we canâ€™t change this clause, we can say that the US legal system is a world class legal system and will offer protection and justice should the situation arise.

That said, we have never entered into any litigation with any of our customers.
