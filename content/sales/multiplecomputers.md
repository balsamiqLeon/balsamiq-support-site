The license for Mockups 3 for Desktop is tied to the user, not a particular machine.

And if you have two different operating systems, that is ok too!  Mockups 3 for Desktop runs on Windows and Mac via Adobe Air.  System requirements can be found on our [download page](https://balsamiq.com/download/).

Install it on any machine you use regularly, and enjoy!
