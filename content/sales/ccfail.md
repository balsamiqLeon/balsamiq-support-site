There are various reasons why a payment may be rejected. Before trying again, double check that you have entered the card number correctly, along with the CVC and expiration date.

If you still have trouble, send us an [email directly](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=Credit Card Failure - FAQ) and include details about what you were trying to buy, and we'll see if we can help you complete the purchase and/or extend your trial while you wait for a resolution with your bank.

For license purchases over $300 we also accept payment by [bank transfer or check](/sales/ordering/#licenses).
