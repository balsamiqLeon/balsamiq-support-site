No, we do not.

Years ago we switched payment processors, and we went from using PayPal to using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). There were many reasons that led us to make the switch, which included easier integration with our system, improved user experience, better support, and lower fees.

Since PayPal no longer processes our payments, we are unable to accept it as a method of payment on our website. This applies to both recurring subscriptions and licenses.
