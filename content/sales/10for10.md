This article applies Wireframes for Confluence Server and Wireframes for Jira Server.

A couple of reasons:

*   Atlassian targets businesses that are bigger than 10 users. The vast majority of our customers are smaller shops.
*   We are a small company, and cannot afford to scale to supporting hundreds of thousands of customers like Atlassian can, at least for now.
*   We want to provide great customer support and [frequent updates](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/) to all of our customers, big or small. These things cost us time and money, as we’re sure you’ll understand.
