Most licenses can be retrieved from our [license retrieval page](https://balsamiq.com/buy/lostkey).

If you need help finding your license but don't have access to the email address used for your purchase:

*   Try your finance department. Our License Information is on all of our invoices and receipts.
*   If the original purchaser is no longer with the company, talk to your IT department. They should have the ability to reinstate an employee's company email account.
*   If you no longer have access to your old email address, but have your License Key, you can update your [sales record](https://balsamiq.com/buy/invoice/).  Once you have looked up your invoice in our system, click "Edit Invoice info" in the upper left corner.

If you have additional questions, please free free to contact us at [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com).
