3.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page where the heading reads _Delete me from..._.
4.  Click the _Remove me Permanently_ button.

Once you click the _Remove me Permanently_ button, you are removed from all of that site's projects. This action cannot be undone. To be added back, you must contact the site owner.
