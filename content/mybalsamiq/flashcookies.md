Sometimes when using a Flash-powered application on the web, you might want to clear your Flash cookies (technically known as Flash Local Shared Objects) to start fresh.

You can easily manage your Website Storage Settings from [this page](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

Please [let us know](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/t/myb) if you have any comments or questions.
