The current versions of myBalsamiq and Mockups 3 for Desktop use different file formats. You can export between the two, but if you are planning to work on the same projects in both versions you may want to use the [old version of Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download/archives/?prefix=mockups-desktop/2.2.28/) (2.2.28) instead.

The resulting BMPR file can be opened directly in Mockups 3 for Desktop (from version 3.5.7 and above).
