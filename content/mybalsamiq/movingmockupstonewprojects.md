There are a couple ways you can go about moving a mockup from one myBalsamiq project to another.

**Note:** If the mockup uses any images or other assets, you will have to move those over to the new project as well.

## Copying and Pasting the Mockup XML

From the myBalsamiq editor, click on **Project** > **Export Mockup XML** (or you can press CTRL/CMD + E). This will copy your mockup to your computer's clipboard.

You can then go to your new project, create a new Mockup, click on **Project** > **Import Mockup XML** (or press CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + E) and paste the XML into the window that appears (using CTRL/CMD + V or right clicking your mouse and selecting paste). Click **Import** and your mockup should appear on the canvas. Once you double check to make sure everything made it over from the original, you can delete the original mockup (if you would like to).

## Downloading and Uploading the Mockup's BMML File

From the [Single Mockup Page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/mockup/) click the [Download BMML link](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/mockup/#mockup-description-permalink-download).

This will download the file version of your mockup.

You can then go to your new project and [upload the .bmml file](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#adding-mockups) from the **New Mockup** Button's drop-down arrow.

Once you double check to make sure everything made it over from the original, you can delete the original mockup (if you would like to).
