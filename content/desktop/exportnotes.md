When you [export your mockups to PDF](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/#exporting-to-pdf) you can choose to export the notes that you've written in the [notes panel](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/#notes) by checking the box labeled "Include mockup notes."

Exported images do not include mockup notes.

Another way to share mockup notes is to [share the project file](/desktop/sharing/#share-balsamiq-files).
