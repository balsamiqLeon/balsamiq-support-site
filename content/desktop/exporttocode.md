Not directly, no.

There are too many technologies for a small company like ours to keep track of and export to, so we don’t plan on adding export capabilities natively any time soon.

Our [BMPR file format](/resources/bmpr-format/) is documented, so you can build a tool that integrates with it if you wish.

If you’d like to write an extension for Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop, [do get in touch](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com), we’d love to help you as much as we can.
