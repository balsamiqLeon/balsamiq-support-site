Design Systems, Pattern Libraries, and Frameworks simplify development and relieve pressure on developers to style user interface components.

While wireframes (low fidelity, non-interactive) may seem like an odd pairing with design systems (high fidelity, backed by working code), they can actually work quite well together!

In a blog post called [**"Using Balsamiq with Pattern Libraries and Frameworks"**](https://blog.balsamiq.com/using-balsamiq-mockups-with-pattern-libraries-and-frameworks/) we describe how they complement each other, given the right organizational framework.

Here is an excerpt from the post and some images showing how Balsamiq components can be "mapped" to a design system or framework:

> The main advantage of pairing a pattern library with Balsamiq is that it can free you from worrying about look, feel, and behavior when designing yet provide pixel-perfect renditions of the final product components.

And, if you use Bootstrap as your framework, you can use our [Bootstrap project starter templates](https://wireframestogo.com/#/search=bootstrap).
