Any set of controls that has been [grouped](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/controls/#grouping-ui-controls) can be cropped to only show a portion of the group. To crop a single control, group it first (yes, a group with only one element). Watch the videos below for more information.

This video shows how you can use a "sprite" image in Balsamiq to create multiple icons using a single image. This is a quick and handy method for working with icons like the ones shown in the video or to create button state variants, for example.
